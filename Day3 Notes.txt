Stack and queues

stack is a linear data type

it follows FILO or LIFO order

it can be done using arrays or LinkedList 

Stack Operations: 
    push     => adding item
    pop      => removing item
    top      => getting the top element
    size     => getting the size of the stack
    isempty  => empty's the stack
    getstack => displaying all the elements in the stack

queues

Queues are also a linear data type
operations in queues 
1. enqueue add value into the queues
2. dequeue removes
3. size gibes the size of the queues
4. isempty checks if the queue is empty or not

we can do operations on both ends
