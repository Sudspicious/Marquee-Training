The two pointer technique involves using two pointers to iterate through a data structure like an array or linked list. They key property is that the pointers move through the data structure in tandem, enabling us to compare or correlate the elements they point to.

Types of pointers:
    - Collision pointers
    - Forward / Parallel pointers
    - Fast / Slow pointers
    - Fixed Distance pointers.(Sliding Window)

Collision pointers
    - Two Sum
    Given a sorted array of integers arr and a target integer target, return true id there exists two elements in the array such that their sum equals target.
    Otherwise, return False.

    - Input Format
    The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the size of the array
    The second line contains n integers, the elements of the arr[] (1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9)
    The third line contains an integer target (1 <= target <= 10^9)

    - Output Format
    Return true if a pair with the sum equal to the target is found, otherwise, return false.

    Sample Input 
    7                       4
    1 2 3 4 6 8 9           1 2 3 9
    10                      7
    Sample Output           
    True                    False

Sliding Window
    - Sliding Window is a tehcnique used for iterating through a finite data set, typically an array or strings in a specific and controlled way
    It involves creating a window , which is a subset of the data, that slides through the larger data set, typically one element at a time, while 
    performing a specific operation on each subset of the data.
    - This technique is commonly used in algorithms like finding subarrays with a specific sum, finding the longest substring with unique characters    
    with unique characters or solving problems that require a fixed sized window to process the elements
    - Types:
        1. Fixed Size Sliding Window
        2. Variable Size Sliding Window
