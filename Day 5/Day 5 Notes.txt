Recursion

    - Any function which calls itself is called as a Recursion.
    - A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.
    - Recursion is the process where a function self calls itself to find the result. The base 
    condition acts as the breakpoint to the self calling process.

Types of Recursion:

    - A function fun is called direct recursive if it calls the same function. A function is called
    indirect recursive if it calls another function say fun_new and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly.
